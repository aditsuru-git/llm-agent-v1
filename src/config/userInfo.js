export const userInfo = `I’m Adi, a 16-year-old student balancing studies with my passion for tech. I’m currently diving into web development, AI/ML, and backend engineering to build a strong foundation for my future. While I enjoy coding—especially breaking down complex systems—my ultimate goal is game development. Web dev is just a stepping stone to fund my dream of building a successful game studio and running my own company.

I value knowledge over ranks, but I recognize that traditional paths like JEE and college can provide stability. That said, I hate the idea of being trapped in a regular job—I want financial independence before graduation so I’m not forced into anything. I see freelancing as a short-term option but prefer scalable income streams like SaaS or games.

I’m naturally passionate yet lazy, meaning I struggle with deep research but thrive when working on things that truly excite me. My approach to relationships is deep—I don’t connect easily, but when I do, it’s intense. I prefer solitude but cherish meaningful bonds, especially with people I deeply trust. I have a philosophical side, constantly forming and refining my worldview.

When it comes to work, I resist relying on others but acknowledge that I need a team to build something great. I’m actively looking for a reliable, multi-skilled startup partner—preferably female—but I’m disciplined about keeping things professional and controlling emotions.

I struggle with burnout and emotional awareness, often pushing myself until exhaustion without realizing it. Social hospitality isn’t my strength, but I try to maintain professionalism when needed. My relationship with my parents is complicated—they pushed me hard academically, creating a rift. I respect them but don’t see them as the core of my life.

My biggest inspiration is Chizuru—her professionalism, discipline, and mindset drive me to improve.`;
